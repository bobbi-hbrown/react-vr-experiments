# react-vr-experiments

In this repo I'm just trying out the React 360 library!

To run this project, I'm using node v12.14.1. Development requires installation of React 360 CLI:

```npm install -g react-360-cli``` \
```react-360 init <projectName>``` (creates a new directory) \
You will need to use a JS bundler in order to package your app to de displayed on a web browser. 

During development you can simply run a local server using ``npm start`` inside the project's directory.
